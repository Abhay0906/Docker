What is Docker Hub Registry:


Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service which allows you to link to code repositories,
 build your images and test them, stores manually pushed images, and links to Docker Cloud so you can deploy images to your hosts. 
It provides a centralized resource for container image discovery, distribution and change management,
 user and team collaboration, and workflow automation throughout the development pipeline.
