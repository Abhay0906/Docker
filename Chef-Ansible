Chef – Chef has a master-agent architecture. 
Chef server runs on the master machine and Chef client runs as an agent on each client machine. 
Also, there is an extra component called workstation, which contains all the configurations which 
are tested and then pushed to central chef server. 
Therefore, it is not that easy.


Puppet – Puppet also has a master-agent architecture.
Puppet server runs on the master machine and Puppet clients runs as an agent on each client machine. 
After that, there is also a certificate signing between the agent and the master. Therefore, it is also not that easy.


Ansible – It has only master running on the server machine, but no agents running on the client machine.
It uses ssh connection to login to client systems or the nodes you want to configure. 
Client machine VM requires no special setup, hence it is faster to setup!

Saltstack – Here Server is called as salt master and clients are called as 
salt minions which run as agents in the client machine.
