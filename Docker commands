docker pull ubuntu    ----->> this will pull the ubuntu image from hub.docker.com

docker image ls       ------>> this will show the images downloaded in your instance

if we have to download any specific version of image:

docker pull ubuntu:2.39 --- >> but we need to know the version of containers available at hub.docker.com


docker search ubuntu   --- >> used to search the image

docker run -d --name <container-name> <image-name>:version   --- >> -d is detached mode (wont give login prompt)

docker ps -a                                       ---- >> this will show all containers in stop or started state

docker ps -f "status=exited"                        --- >> list exited containers

docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name httpd2 httpd:latest   --- >> 8080 is host port and 80 is container port

docker exec -it <nameofcontainer> bash                ---- >> this will connect to a running container
we can try to exit out of this and this should not terminate the container.
